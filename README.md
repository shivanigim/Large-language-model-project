#### LangChain Data Scientist Assistant
This repository contains a project that utilizes LangChain and the OpenAI API to create an LLM-based agent capable of performing various data science tasks. The agent can analyze data from an Excel file, clean the data, discover relationships between variables, select appropriate models, and make future predictions. This assistant aims to streamline day-to-day tasks for data scientists.

## Features
Data Cleaning: Automatically cleans and preprocesses the data for analysis.
Relationship Discovery: Identifies relationships between variables in the dataset.
Model Selection: Chooses and applies the most appropriate model for the given data.
Forecasting: Makes predictions based on historical data.

## Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the provided .ipynb file)
pip install langchain openai pandas openpyxl
